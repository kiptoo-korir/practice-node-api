# Node API

Very simple api in node js/express, developed solely for the purpose of practise in node js itself and trying to learn a few industry best practices as referenced in [nodebestpractices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices). Feel free to checkout these best practices in node js, I assure you there's some awesome stuff there.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the project `git clone git@github.com:kiptoo-korir/practice-node-api.git`
2. Install the dependencies through `npm i`
3. Create your database in postgres
4. Run the queries found in the sql files located in the db/migrations directory
5. Create a .env file from the .env.example in the root directory
6. Setup your .env file by filling in your database credentials among other details

## Run The Server

In the development environment, nodemon is used to run the server, using the command

**`npm run dev`**

## Invitation to comment
