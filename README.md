# Node API

Very simple api in node js/express, developed solely for the purpose of practise in node js itself and trying to learn a few industry best practices as referenced in [nodebestpractices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices). Feel free to checkout these best practices in node js, I assure you there's some awesome stuff there.

## Project Setup

After cloning the project, change the .env.example file to a .env file. Place your database credentials as outlined in the .env file after you have created the database. Run the sql file located in the db/migrations directory, we will move to migrations in future. Once done, the api will be ready to run through the command

**`npm run dev`**

## Invitation to comment

Feel free to pitch in with contributions and or corrections on the code, Thanks.
